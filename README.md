# CypressTesting

Cypress is a powerful and user-friendly testing tool that can be used to test Angular applications. In this guide, we will cover how to set up Cypress for testing an Angular project and some best practices for using it effectively..

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running component testing

Run `npm run cy:open` to execute the unit tests via cypress (https://www.cypress.io/).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run cy:run` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
